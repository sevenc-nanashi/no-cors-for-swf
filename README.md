# No CORS for Flash

"No CORS for Flash" removes the CORS restriction from all Flash (SWF) files, allowing you to play games and watch videos on websites that have disabled Flash due to the end of support.
This extension is intended for use with the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) project, which is a Flash Player emulator written in Rust.
